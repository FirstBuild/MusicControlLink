# MusicControlLink
nRF24-based system for exchanging music control parameters wirelessly

This project is based on [this tutorial](http://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-wireless-communication-nrf24l01-tutorial/) from Dejan Nedelkovski

There are too parts to this project, a hub, which receives inputs, and control surfaces, which send control changes to the hub.  The hub then forwards the information on to other units as needed.
